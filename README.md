# COAL-SH model for exotic particle production in RHICs
COAL-SH model is a phase-space quark coalescence model that can be used to make prediction on production of exotic particles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions [1]. The code is written in MATLAB.

To run this code, open the window of MATLAB or octave, and run
MainCoal

The results are shown in Tab. II and Tab. III in Ref. [1].
